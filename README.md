# Liar Poker (Commune) Monte Carlo Simulation
Matlab Monte Carlo simulation for probabilities of different possible hand combinations. You can read more about the card game [Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune_(card_game)) here.
## Installation
You can download the zip file and extract it into your default Matlab directory.
## Usage
The key Matlab files are examples.m and script.m. The examples.m comes with some sample usages of the Monte Carlo Simulation and the script.m will recreate the probabilities table.

Be careful! It takes an extraordinarily long time to recreate though.

If you just want to see the fruits of our labor, you can open the "Final_ProbabilitiesTableAllCombos.xlsx" to see our results.
